### Hello world ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harry and I'm an graduate Software Engineer in Auckland, NZ - currently working on Geneious Prime/Biologics with a brilliant team of people at Biomatters, NZ.

Most of my experience lies in Lua, Java, C/C++, Ruby, Python, PHP, Go, JavaScript, and TypeScript (including various web stacks/frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Svelte, AngularJS and RxJS).

In my free time, I'm working on [TPA](https://github.com/hbomb79/TPA), a concurrent importer for a home movie server, implemented in Go.
