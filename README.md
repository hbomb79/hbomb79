### Hello world ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harry and I'm an undergraduate Software Engineer in Auckland, NZ - graduating at the end of 2021.

Most of my experience lies in Lua, Java, C/C++, Ruby, Python, PHP, GoLang, JavaScript, and TypeScript (including various web stacks/frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Svelte, AngularJS and RxJS).

Currently, I'm working on [TPA](https://github.com/hbomb79/TPA), a concurrent importer for a home movie server, implemented in GoLang.
